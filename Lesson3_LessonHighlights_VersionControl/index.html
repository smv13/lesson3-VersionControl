        <!-- First Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic1">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Brosen_windrose.svg/2000px-Brosen_windrose.svg.png">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #1
                <span class="text-muted">Directions</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The first key concept was following the directions step by step. In order to successfully complete each task, you needed to make sure you were following direction in the order it was presented to you. This made the entire process easier to understand and I was able to complete it in a timely matter. Like the instructions for Github. You need to follow it in the order we were given to complete the assignment correctly. </p>

        <!-- Second Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic2">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #2
                <span class="text-muted">Connections</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The second concept was about the connection. The connection between Github and Cloud9 was extremely crucial to complete the assignment and link up the two websites. They go hand in hand in performing. You connect the two workspaces and respository together so they can work together and create the work you are wanted. It was interesting to see how simple it is to link the two and  have the information shared.Without the connection there is no way to complete the assignment and see it through and through. </p>

        <!-- Third Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic3">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2013/09/10-Websites-that-Teach-Coding-and-More.jpg">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #3
                <span class="text-muted">Coding</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The third concept I learned was the coding that goes along with connecting the two together. You have to register them so they sync up. It was intriguing to see how all you do is type in simple codes on Cloud9 and they process the information from both sites. These codes are crucial, especially for this class and using them to connect the two and complete each assignment. It seems like for all the work they are doing, the codes should be more complex but they aren't.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #4
                <span class="text-muted">Uploading Files</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The fourth key concept I learned was how easy it was to add files to Cloud9. It seems like it should be more difficult than dragging over previous folders. It made the process easy and quick to access. It makes it so you can add the entire folder and all the files present in that folder in one easy click. It keeps them organized and simple to understand and retrieve. You are able to add any files and the coding for them. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #5
                <span class="text-muted">Adding information</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The last key concept I learned was during this assignment and how you can go back and add to previously made webpages such as this one. There are areas you can insert your own words like I am now. It is interesting to see how coding and the creating of websites, webpages, workspaces, etc., work. You are able to add files and then go into the files and add or take out information and are able to watch live what the changes are doing. It helped a lot with seeing if the information was going in the right places while I was doing it rather than having to go back later and try and figure out where I made mistakes.</p>
